# Components
All component resource endpoints are prefixed `/component` (e.g. `/components/forms/{id}`)

- `Collection` (docs coming soon)
- `Form` (docs coming soon)
- Creating your own components

## Creating your own components
- Extending `AbstractComponent`
- Implementing `Publishable`
- Implementing `FileInterface` and `FileTrait` (should probably refactor to work similar to `Publishable`)
- Implementing `TimestampedInterface` and `TimestampedTrait` (should probably refactor to work similar to `Publishable`)

### Reusable traits
- `ComponentGroupsTrait` (docs coming soon)
